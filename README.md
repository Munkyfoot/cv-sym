# OpenCV-Python Symmetry Experiment

## About
This project experiments with various realtime symmetry techniques using the opencv-python library.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- - numpy >= 1.16
- - opencv-python OR opencv-contrib-python >= 4.10

## Get Started
1. Set up your environment with python 3.7. A virtual environment is highly recommended. I use and suggest Anaconda.
2. Install python modules
- - pip install numpy
- - pip install opencv-python OR pip install opencv-contrib-python
3. Clone this project to your local machine and cd into the directory.
4. Run 'python sym.py' from the command line.
5. Controls
- - Hit 'q' to close the camera window
- - Hit 'm' to cycle through the symmetry modes
